# projects

Hello, my name is mutsawashe gabrielle shamu, but i also go by gabrielle. Here are a few of my technical projects that i have completed. One of which is a database using SQL. It includes a scenario that i created for a cinema looking to introduce a rewards system to their network. Within the database are tables that include customer names, IDs, ages, points, and rewards. i used DML commands and four constraints while creating the table. i joined tables and used aggregate functions as well as normalised the database.

i created an API to integrate the database i made to the web. i used node.js as my construct. i implemented API endpoints with appropriate functionality using Express.js (in Node.js). i added a HTTP response message/error handling to my endpoints implementation.
